#TXAdminINGAME
This FiveM script doesnt use a framework, and it implements the txAdmin panel in game with the command /admin

As this is my first script, im kinda newbie there isnt a way to close the admin with GUI, u can close it by clicking F8 and typing closeadmin!

#To give a player the hability of opening the menu insert the following line in your server.cfg
add_ace identifier.steam:steamidhere "txadmin.menu.perm" allow

#or

add_ace identifier.rockstar:licensehere "txadmin.menu.perm" allow

Remember to change the index.html file, in the IFRAME add your txAdmin link! (No it cant be localhost)

Also have in mind you cant use the FiveM login as they reject the iframe request.

To have the latest features always make sure you are using the LATEST (not latest recommended nor optional) version of FXServer artifacts.

No, i did not make txAdmin
